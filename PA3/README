Program: webproxy.c 

Purpose:

Create web proxy for HTTP GET requests with working page cache
My program takes a request from the client (Firefox, Chrome) and checks its own
internal cache and proceeds to send that if the files exist. If the files do 
not exist the web proxy goes to an HTTP server over port 80 (if not specified)
and retrieves and information and caches it for next time. 

How to run:

1) make clean --> no older versions of compiled code in folder
2) make --> creates new compiled executable
3) ./webproxy <port> --> starts webproxy of port # supplied
4) Test
	1) Option 1: telnet
		You can use telnet to test the functionality of the webserver
		1) telnet localhost <port> 
		   GET http://www.google.com HTTP/1.0
		   This should return the header files for google.com
	2) Option 2: browser
		You can use firefox or chome as long as the proxy server is 
		set up correctly on the browser
		1) Set up proxy on browser
		2) Run proxy on same port
		3) netsys.cs.colorado.edu
			You can use in browser inspection of network for 
			indepth information about each packet
