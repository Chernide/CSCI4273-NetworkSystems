Program: dfc.c/dfs.c 

Purpose:

Create a distributed file system that has reliability through redundancy. This program works as long as files size/4 < 8192 and does not work with images, but works with text files. These servers are not robust and will break if a server crashes midrun. Other than that LIST,PUT,GET all work will full functionality. 

*GET command files are written to /Gotten_files directory within client/server folder*

How to run:

1) make clean --> Clears all user files and directories and removes old compiled code
2) make --> creates new compiled executable
3) ./dfc dfc.conf --> starts client for the user defined in the dfc.conf
4) Run Servers
	./dfs <Server dir> <port #>
	./dfs <Server dir> <port #>
	./dfs <Server dir> <port #>
	./dfs <Server dir> <port #>
	*Run all four with dirrent ports and directorys (/DFS[1,2,3,4])
4) Test
	1) PUT foo1.txt
	2) PUT bar.txt
	3) LIST --> Shows both file names without [incomplete]
	4) Go delete all .bar.txt.1 pieces
	5) LIST --> will show bar.txt [incomplete]
	6) GET foo1.txt
	7) Check /Gotten_files/ for foo1.txt file.
